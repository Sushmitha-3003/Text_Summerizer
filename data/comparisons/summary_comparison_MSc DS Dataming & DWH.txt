WHAT IS DATA MINING?
What is data mining?
•Data mining refers toextracting or“mining" knowledge from large amounts of
data .
•Data mining can also bedefined asthe exploration and analysis oflarge
quantities ofdata inorder todiscover meaningful patterns and rules .
•Data mining isthesearch forrelationships and global patterns that exist inlarge
databases but are ‘hidden’ among the vast amount ofdata, such asa
relationship between patient data and their medical diagnosis .
•These relationships represent valuable knowledge about thedatabase and the
objects inthedatabase .•Data mining isthe analysis step ofthe "knowledge discovery in
databases" process, orKDD .
•Data mining isthepractice ofautomatically searching large stores of
data todiscover patterns and trends that gobeyond simple analysis .
•Data mining uses sophisticated mathematical algorithms tosegment
thedata and evaluate theprobability offuture events .
•Data mining isalso known asKnowledge Discovery inData (KDD) .Why do we need ...

•Data mining can help improve intrusion detection byadding alevel offocus to
anomaly detection .Ithelps ananalyst todistinguish anactivity from common
everyday network activity .Data mining also helps extract data which ismore relevant
totheproblem .•Customer Segmentation
•Traditional market research may help ustosegment customers butdata mining
goes indeep and increases market effectiveness .Data mining aids inaligning
thecustomers into adistinct segment and cantailor theneeds according tothe
customers . •The types  of data  sources  : Databases  (Eg: Oracle,  MySQL,  PostgreSql  etc), Flat Files  (CSV,  JSON,  
XML,  Excel),  API & Web  Services  (RESTful  APIs,  SOAP),  Cloud  Storage  (AWS  S3, Google  Cloud  
Storage  etc), Streaming  Data  (logs,  IOT sensors),  Enterprise  Applications(SAP ,  ERP systems,  
Salesforce),
•Extraction  Methods  : Full Extraction  , Incremental  extraction  (extracts  only  new  or modified  
records  since  last extraction,  uses  timestamps),  Streaming  extraction  (real -time  extraction  of 
continuous  data  flow,  used  for live dashboard  : monitoring  stock  prices  or IOT device  data)
•Common  tools  are SQL queries,  ETL tools  like Talend,  Apache  Nifi, Microsoft  SSIS,  Python  
Libraries  : Pandas,  Beautiful  Soup  (for Web  scraping)•Challenges in Data Extraction
•Data Heterogeneity:  Different data formats and structures. While  OLAP  systems  can also query  real-time  data,  they  are typically  used  to analyze  data  that has 
been  periodically  loaded  from  OLTP  systems  or other  sources .OLTP systems OLAP systems
Enable the real -time execution of large numbers of database 
transactions by large numbers of peopleUsually involve querying many records (even all records) in a 
database for analytical purposes
Require lightning -fast response timesRequire response times that are orders of magnitude slower 
than those required by OLTP
Modify small amounts of data frequently and usually involve a 
balance of reads and writesDo not modify data at all; workloads are usually read -intensive
Use indexed data to improve response timesStore data in columnar format to allow easy access to large 
numbers of records
Require frequent or concurrent database backups Require far less frequent database backup
Require relatively little storage spaceTypically have significant storage space requirements, because 
they store large amounts of historical data
Usually run simple queries involving just one or a few records Run complex queries involving large numbers of recordsWhat is ETL?

•Data mining refers toextracting or“mining" knowledge from large amounts of
data . •The data  mining  process  depends  on the data  compiled  in the data  
warehousing  phase  to recognize  meaningful  patterns .Comparison between data mining and data warehousing
Data Warehousing Data Mining
A data  warehouse  is database  system  which  is 
designed  for analytical  analysis  instead  of 
transactional  work .Data mining is the process of analyzing data patterns. •Data  Loading
•Data  Access•Integrated : A data  warehouse  is created  by integrating  data  from  
numerous  different  sources  such  that from  mainframe  computers  and a 
relational  database .
